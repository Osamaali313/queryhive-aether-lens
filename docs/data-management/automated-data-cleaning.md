# Automated Data Cleaning

Understand how QueryHive AI automatically cleans and prepares your data for analysis, and learn how to optimize the cleaning process for your specific needs.

## Overview of Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt, inaccurate, or irrelevant parts of a dataset. QueryHive AI performs this automatically, but understanding the process helps you prepare better data and interpret results more effectively.

### Why Data Cleaning Matters

**Impact on Analysis Quality**
- **Accuracy**: Clean data produces more reliable insights
- **Performance**: Processed data analyzes faster
- **ML Model Quality**: Better data leads to better predictions
- **Confidence**: Higher confidence in results and recommendations

**Common Data Issues**
- Missing or null values
- Inconsistent formatting
- Duplicate records
- Outliers and anomalies
- Inconsistent data types
- Encoding problems

## Automatic Cleaning Process

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment

**Data Profiling**
QueryHive AI first analyzes your data to understand:
```
Data Profile Report:
• Total rows: 10,247
• Total columns: 15
• Data types detected: 8 numeric, 5 text, 2 date
• Missing values: 3.2% overall
• Duplicate rows: 12 detected
• Encoding: UTF-8 confirmed
• Quality score: 87% (Good)
```

**Issue Detection**
The system identifies common problems:
- **Type Inconsistencies**: Numbers stored as text
- **Format Variations**: Different date formats in same column
- **Missing Value Patterns**: Random vs. systematic gaps
- **Outlier Detection**: Values outside normal ranges
- **Duplicate Analysis**: Exact and near-duplicate records

### Phase 2: Automated Corrections

**Data Type Standardization**
```
Before Cleaning:
price_column: ["$299.99", "156.50", "$1,247.83", "89.95"]

After Cleaning:
price_column: [299.99, 156.50, 1247.83, 89.95]

Transformations Applied:
• Removed currency symbols ($)
• Removed thousands separators (,)
• Converted to numeric type
• Validated numeric ranges
```

**Date Standardization**
```
Before Cleaning:
date_column: ["01/15/2024", "2024-01-16", "Jan 17, 2024", "1/18/24"]

After Cleaning:
date_column: ["2024-01-15", "2024-01-16", "2024-01-17", "2024-01-18"]

Transformations Applied:
• Standardized to ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
• Resolved ambiguous dates using context
• Validated date ranges
• Handled timezone information
```

**Text Normalization**
```
Before Cleaning:
category_column: ["Electronics", "ELECTRONICS", "electronics", "Electronic"]

After Cleaning:
category_column: ["Electronics", "Electronics", "Electronics", "Electronics"]

Transformations Applied:
• Standardized capitalization
• Resolved spelling variations
• Trimmed whitespace
• Unified similar categories
```

### Phase 3: Missing Value Handling

**Missing Value Strategies**
QueryHive AI uses intelligent strategies based on data type and context:

**Numeric Columns**
```
Strategy Selection:
• Mean imputation: For normally distributed data
• Median imputation: For skewed distributions
• Mode imputation: For categorical-like numbers
• Forward/backward fill: For time series data
• Predictive imputation: Using other columns

Example:
Original: [100, 150, null, 200, 175, null, 125]
Strategy: Median imputation
Result: [100, 150, 150, 200, 175, 150, 125]
```

**Categorical Columns**
```
Strategy Selection:
• Mode imputation: Most frequent value
• Category creation: "Unknown" or "Other"
• Contextual imputation: Based on related columns
• Pattern-based filling: Using business rules

Example:
Original: ["Premium", "Standard", null, "Premium", null]
Strategy: Mode imputation
Result: ["Premium", "Standard", "Premium", "Premium", "Premium"]
```

**Date Columns**
```
Strategy Selection:
• Interpolation: For sequential dates
• Business rule filling: Using domain knowledge
• Related column imputation: Using other date fields
• Default value assignment: For specific contexts

Example:
Original: ["2024-01-15", null, "2024-01-17", null]
Strategy: Linear interpolation
Result: ["2024-01-15", "2024-01-16", "2024-01-17", "2024-01-18"]
```

### Phase 4: Outlier Management

**Outlier Detection Methods**
```
Statistical Methods:
• Z-score analysis (values > 3 standard deviations)
• Interquartile Range (IQR) method
• Modified Z-score for skewed data
• Isolation Forest for multivariate outliers

Business Context Methods:
• Domain-specific range validation
• Historical pattern comparison
• Cross-column consistency checks
• Temporal anomaly detection
```

**Outlier Treatment Options**
```
Treatment Strategies:
1. Flagging: Mark outliers for review
2. Capping: Limit to reasonable ranges
3. Transformation: Log or square root scaling
4. Removal: Delete extreme outliers
5. Imputation: Replace with estimated values

Example - Sales Amount Outliers:
Original: [100, 150, 200, 50000, 175, 125]
Detected Outlier: 50000 (Z-score: 4.2)
Treatment: Cap at 99th percentile (500)
Result: [100, 150, 200, 500, 175, 125]
```

## Advanced Cleaning Features

### Intelligent Duplicate Detection

**Exact Duplicates**
```
Detection:
Row 1: ["John Smith", "john@email.com", "2024-01-15"]
Row 2: ["John Smith", "john@email.com", "2024-01-15"]
Action: Remove duplicate (keep first occurrence)
```

**Near Duplicates**
```
Detection Algorithm:
Row 1: ["John Smith", "john@email.com", "555-1234"]
Row 2: ["Jon Smith", "john@email.com", "555-1234"]
Similarity Score: 95%
Action: Flag for manual review or auto-merge
```

**Fuzzy Matching**
```
Company Name Standardization:
• "Apple Inc" → "Apple Inc."
• "Apple Incorporated" → "Apple Inc."
• "Apple Computer Inc" → "Apple Inc."
• "APPLE INC." → "Apple Inc."

Algorithm: Levenshtein distance + business rules
Confidence: 98% match probability
```

### Cross-Column Validation

**Consistency Checks**
```
Business Rule Validation:
• Birth date vs. Age calculation
• Start date vs. End date logic
• Price vs. Discount amount validation
• Geographic consistency (City, State, Country)

Example:
birth_date: "1990-05-15"
age: 25
Calculated age: 34
Issue: Age inconsistency detected
Resolution: Update age to 34 or flag for review
```

**Referential Integrity**
```
Foreign Key Validation:
• Customer IDs exist in customer table
• Product codes match product catalog
• Category assignments are valid
• Geographic codes are standardized

Example:
Order record: customer_id = "CUST999"
Customer table: No record for "CUST999"
Action: Flag as orphaned record or create placeholder
```

### Data Enrichment

**Automatic Enhancement**
```
Geographic Enrichment:
Input: "New York"
Enhanced: {
  "city": "New York",
  "state": "NY",
  "country": "USA",
  "timezone": "EST",
  "coordinates": [40.7128, -74.0060]
}
```

**Derived Fields**
```
Calculated Columns:
• Total Amount = Quantity × Unit Price
• Age = Current Date - Birth Date
• Days Since Last Purchase = Current Date - Last Purchase Date
• Category Hierarchy = Main Category → Sub Category

Example:
order_date: "2024-01-15"
current_date: "2024-01-30"
→ days_since_order: 15
```
