# Your First Data Analysis

This comprehensive tutorial will walk you through performing your first complete data analysis with QueryHive AI, from upload to insights.

## Prerequisites

- QueryHive AI account (see [Quick Start Guide](./quick-start-guide.md))
- A CSV file with at least 50 rows of data
- Basic understanding of your data structure

## Tutorial Overview

We'll analyze a sample sales dataset to demonstrate:
1. Data upload and validation
2. Natural language querying
3. Machine learning analysis
4. Insight generation and sharing

## Step 1: Prepare Your Data

### Sample Dataset Structure
For this tutorial, we'll use a sales dataset with these columns:
- `date`: Transaction date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `customer_id`: Unique customer identifier
- `product_name`: Name of the product sold
- `category`: Product category
- `quantity`: Number of items sold
- `unit_price`: Price per unit
- `total_amount`: Total transaction value
- `sales_rep`: Sales representative name
- `region`: Geographic region

### Data Preparation Tips
```csv
date,customer_id,product_name,category,quantity,unit_price,total_amount,sales_rep,region
2024-01-15,CUST001,Laptop Pro,Electronics,1,1299.99,1299.99,John Smith,North
2024-01-15,CUST002,Office Chair,Furniture,2,249.99,499.98,Sarah Johnson,South
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use consistent date formats
- Avoid special characters in headers
- Ensure numeric columns contain only numbers
- Remove empty rows and columns

## Step 2: Upload and Validate Data

### Upload Process
1. **Navigate to Upload**: Click "Data Upload" tab
2. **Select File**: Drag your CSV file or click "Choose Files"
3. **Review Detection**: QueryHive AI automatically detects:
   - Column data types (text, number, date, boolean)
   - Data quality issues
   - Suggested improvements

### Data Validation Results
QueryHive AI will show:
- **Column Summary**: Data types and sample values
- **Quality Score**: Overall data completeness and consistency
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for data improvement

```
‚úÖ Data Quality Score: 94%
üìä 10 columns detected
üîç 1,247 rows processed
‚ö†Ô∏è 3 minor issues found (empty cells in 'sales_rep' column)
```

## Step 3: Natural Language Analysis

### Basic Queries
Start with simple questions to understand your data:

**Revenue Analysis**
```
"What's the total revenue for each month?"
```
*Expected Response*: Monthly revenue breakdown with trend analysis

**Product Performance**
```
"Which products generate the most revenue?"
```
*Expected Response*: Top products ranked by total sales with percentages

**Customer Insights**
```
"Who are our top 10 customers by purchase amount?"
```
*Expected Response*: Customer ranking with purchase history

### Advanced Queries
Progress to more complex analytical questions:

**Trend Analysis**
```
"Show me sales trends by region over the last 6 months"
```
*Expected Response*: Regional performance comparison with growth rates

**Correlation Analysis**
```
"Is there a relationship between product price and sales volume?"
```
*Expected Response*: Correlation coefficient with scatter plot visualization

**Seasonal Patterns**
```
"Are there seasonal patterns in our sales data?"
```
*Expected Response*: Seasonal decomposition with peak periods identified

## Step 4: Machine Learning Analysis

### Linear Regression Analysis
**Purpose**: Predict sales based on various factors

1. **Select Model**: Choose "Linear Regression" from ML models
2. **Configure Parameters**: 
   - Target variable: `total_amount`
   - Features: `quantity`, `unit_price`, `region`
3. **Run Analysis**: Click "Run Model"

**Expected Results**:
```
üìà Linear Regression Results
Equation: total_amount = 1.02 * quantity + 0.98 * unit_price + region_factor
R-squared: 0.87 (Strong relationship)
Confidence: 94%

Key Insights:
‚Ä¢ Quantity is the strongest predictor of total sales
‚Ä¢ Regional differences account for 15% of variance
‚Ä¢ Model explains 87% of sales variation
```

### Clustering Analysis
**Purpose**: Identify customer segments

1. **Select Model**: Choose "K-Means Clustering"
2. **Configure**: Let AI auto-select optimal cluster count
3. **Run Analysis**: Execute clustering algorithm

**Expected Results**:
```
üéØ Customer Segmentation Results
3 distinct customer segments identified:

Segment 1: High-Value Customers (23%)
‚Ä¢ Average order: $1,247
‚Ä¢ Purchase frequency: 2.3x per month
‚Ä¢ Preferred categories: Electronics, Premium

Segment 2: Regular Customers (54%)
‚Ä¢ Average order: $387
‚Ä¢ Purchase frequency: 1.1x per month
‚Ä¢ Preferred categories: Office, Furniture

Segment 3: Occasional Buyers (23%)
‚Ä¢ Average order: $156
‚Ä¢ Purchase frequency: 0.4x per month
‚Ä¢ Preferred categories: Accessories, Supplies
```

### Anomaly Detection
**Purpose**: Find unusual patterns or outliers

1. **Select Model**: Choose "Anomaly Detection"
2. **Set Sensitivity**: Use default threshold (2 standard deviations)
3. **Run Analysis**: Identify anomalies

**Expected Results**:
```
üîç Anomaly Detection Results
12 anomalies detected (0.96% of data)

Notable Anomalies:
‚Ä¢ Transaction #1247: $15,000 order (10x normal)
‚Ä¢ Customer CUST089: 47 orders in one day
‚Ä¢ Product "Luxury Desk": 500% price increase

Recommendations:
‚Ä¢ Investigate high-value transactions for fraud
‚Ä¢ Review bulk order processes

- **Solution**: Clean data, remove empty rows, standardize formats

### Analysis Errors
**Issue**: "Insufficient data for analysis"
- **Solution**: Ensure minimum 50 rows for basic analysis, 200+ for ML

**Issue**: "No numeric columns found"
- **Solution**: Verify numeric data is properly formatted (no text in number columns)

### Performance Issues
**Issue**: "Analysis taking too long"
- **Solution**: Reduce dataset size or simplify query complexity

**Issue**: "Memory errors"
- **Solution**: Split large datasets into smaller chunks

## Next Steps

After completing your first analysis:

1. **Explore Advanced Features**: Try knowledge graphs and automated pipelines
2. **Set Up Monitoring**: Create alerts for key metrics
3. **Build Dashboards**: Create custom visualizations for stakeholders
