# Knowledge Graph Construction

Learn how QueryHive AI automatically builds knowledge graphs from your data, revealing hidden relationships and enabling advanced pattern discovery.

## What is a Knowledge Graph?

A knowledge graph is a network of interconnected entities and their relationships, representing knowledge in a structured, machine-readable format. In QueryHive AI, knowledge graphs help you:

- **Discover Hidden Connections**: Find relationships you didn't know existed
- **Visualize Complex Data**: See your data as an interconnected network
- **Enable Advanced Queries**: Ask questions about relationships and paths
- **Improve AI Understanding**: Enhance the AI's context about your domain

### Key Components

**Entities**: The "things" in your data
- Customers, products, locations, events, concepts
- Automatically extracted from your datasets
- Enriched with properties and attributes

**Relationships**: Connections between entities
- "Customer purchased Product"
- "Product belongs to Category"
- "Order shipped to Location"
- Weighted by strength and frequency

**Properties**: Attributes of entities and relationships
- Customer demographics, product specifications
- Relationship metadata (dates, amounts, frequencies)
- Confidence scores and data quality indicators

## How Knowledge Graphs are Built

### 1. Entity Extraction

**Automatic Detection**
QueryHive AI analyzes your data to identify entities:

```
From Sales Data:
• Customers: CUST_001, CUST_002, etc.
• Products: "Laptop Pro", "Office Chair", etc.
• Categories: "Electronics", "Furniture", etc.
• Locations: "New York", "California", etc.
• Sales Reps: "John Smith", "Sarah Johnson", etc.
```

**Entity Types**
The system recognizes common entity types:
- **Person**: Names, employees, customers
- **Organization**: Companies, departments, suppliers
- **Location**: Cities, regions, addresses
- **Product**: Items, services, SKUs
- **Event**: Transactions, meetings, activities
- **Concept**: Categories, classifications, topics

**Entity Enrichment**
Each entity is enhanced with:
- Properties from your data
- Calculated metrics (frequency, importance)
- External data connections (when available)
- Confidence scores for accuracy

### 2. Relationship Discovery

**Co-occurrence Analysis**
Relationships are identified when entities appear together:
- Same transaction → "Customer purchased Product"
- Same time period → "Events occurred simultaneously"
- Same category → "Products are similar"

**Pattern Recognition**
Advanced algorithms detect:
- **Hierarchical**: Category contains Product
- **Sequential**: Event A leads to Event B
- **Causal**: Factor X influences Outcome Y
- **Associative**: Items frequently bought together

**Relationship Weighting**
Each relationship receives a weight based on:
- Frequency of co-occurrence
- Strength of association
- Business importance
- Data quality and confidence

### 3. Graph Construction

**Network Building**
The system creates a network where:
- Nodes represent entities
- Edges represent relationships
- Weights indicate relationship strength
- Clusters show related groups

**Quality Assurance**
Automated validation ensures:
- Relationship accuracy
- Entity disambiguation
- Duplicate removal
- Consistency checking
