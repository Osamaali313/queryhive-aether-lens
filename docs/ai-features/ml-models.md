# Machine Learning Models

Comprehensive guide to QueryHive AI's built-in machine learning capabilities. Learn how to leverage advanced algorithms for predictive analytics, pattern recognition, and data insights.

## Overview of ML Capabilities

QueryHive AI provides four core machine learning models, each designed for specific analytical tasks:

1. **Linear Regression**: Predict continuous values and understand relationships
2. **K-Means Clustering**: Discover natural groupings in your data
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Identify outliers and unusual patterns
4. **Time Series Analysis**: Analyze trends and forecast future values

All models are:
- **No-code**: Run with a single click
- **Automated**: Smart parameter selection
- **Interpretable**: Clear explanations of results
- **Scalable**: Handle datasets from hundreds to millions of rows

## Linear Regression Analysis

### What It Does
Linear regression finds mathematical relationships between variables, allowing you to:
- Predict future values based on historical data
- Understand which factors most influence outcomes
- Quantify the strength of relationships
- Make data-driven forecasts

### When to Use
- **Sales Forecasting**: Predict revenue based on marketing spend, seasonality, etc.
- **Price Optimization**: Understand how price changes affect demand
- **Performance Analysis**: Identify factors that drive business metrics
- **Resource Planning**: Predict resource needs based on growth factors

### How It Works

**1. Automatic Variable Selection**
QueryHive AI automatically identifies:
- **Target Variable**: What you want to predict (dependent variable)
- **Predictor Variables**: Factors that influence the target (independent variables)
- **Data Quality**: Ensures sufficient data for reliable analysis

**2. Model Training**
The algorithm:
- Finds the best-fit line through your data points
- Calculates coefficients for each predictor variable
- Determines the strength of relationships (R-squared)
- Validates model accuracy using statistical tests

**3. Results Interpretation**
You receive:
- **Equation**: Mathematical formula for predictions
- **Coefficients**: Impact of each variable
- **R-squared**: How well the model explains variance (0-1 scale)
- **Confidence Intervals**: Reliability ranges for predictions

### Example Analysis

**Business Question**: "What factors drive our monthly sales?"

**Data Required**:
- Monthly sales revenue (target)
- Marketing spend
- Number of sales reps
- Seasonal indicators
- Economic factors

**Sample Results**:
```
üìà Linear Regression Analysis: Monthly Sales Prediction

Equation: Sales = 45,000 + (2.3 √ó Marketing) + (8,500 √ó Sales_Reps) + (12,000 √ó Season_Factor)

Key Insights:
‚Ä¢ R-squared: 0.87 (Model explains 87% of sales variation)
‚Ä¢ Marketing ROI: Every $1 spent generates $2.30 in sales
‚Ä¢ Sales Rep Impact: Each additional rep adds $8,500 monthly
‚Ä¢ Seasonal Effect: Q4 boost of $12,000 on average

Predictions:
‚Ä¢ Next month (with $50K marketing, 12 reps): $247,000 ¬± $18,000
‚Ä¢ Confidence Level: 95%
